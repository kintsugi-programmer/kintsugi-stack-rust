    Block Comments
    For Multilines

    // Multiline Convention
    // So we're doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
    // multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
    // explain what's going on.

    // println!("Rust is Worst Language"); 
    // above code is wrong and we don't want to use as code from compiler but we don't wanna delete too as we don't know future !!!
